# Nicholas Boyce

I graduated from Bowdoin College in 2022 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Economics. I spent the first year out of college working in investment banking across insurance, healthcare, and fintech companies. After a yearlong sabbatical to attend to my physical and mental health, I've been diving into software engineering to develop my problem solving skills and nourish my creativity! I'm also a never-alum of the Recurse Center!

I'm currently learning about:
- Typescript and SQL
- Building and designing with an accessibility-first mindset
